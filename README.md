Notes on My Approach

Finding a working AI image generation API was quite a challenge I tried Google Gemini, ChatGPT, DALL·E, and a few others.
In the end, @huggingface/inference made my day with its simplicity and reliability.

Redux Toolkit was a bit tricky at first, but I learned a lot while implementing state management for prompts and models.
I’ve done my best to cover all the flows and requirements of the task.

Looking forward to hearing the good news thank you
